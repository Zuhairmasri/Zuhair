										<p align="left">I am a high-achieving Palestinian Student living in Gaza. Since a young age, I have been through a vigorous path of academic and extracurricular engagement. From school to internationally-funded programs, my journey was rich with experience, and there were many achievements along the way. Currently, I am looking to bring my journey to the arc of higher education.

										<h2 class="major">Education and Programs</h2>
										<p>Since the start of my schooling career, I had the opportunity to attend a private school, Holy Family School - Gaza of the latin-patriarchate schools, where I grew up in an environment dedicated to maximizing my academic capabilities and skills, and indulge an exquisite style of learning and material. Other than school, I was hand-picked to attend programs like Abraham Lincoln program, and the Hope Fund program administered by AMIDEAST as a student.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Extracurricular Activity</h2>
										<p align="left">During the last three years, I have dedicated myself to an academic journey, which, actually, was not strictly limited to the academics side of things. I have also tried my best to pay back to the community that housed me both as an individual and a dear citizen. I joined organizations like “Atfaluna Society” for deaf children, where I took part as a teacher for children with specific needs. I spent lots of time volunteering at “Al-Rantisi” hospital for children, and I helped initiate a local summer camp, “Safari Camp,” spreading the culture among the youth.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Studying in the U.S and Union</h2>
									<p>After the many years of academic dedication and community involvement, I got to see the fruits of my hard work. The time I spent studying for the SAT I test, the American Scholastic Aptitude Test, left me with a highly-respected score of 1430/1600, putting me higher than 95% of test takers globally (as stated on my SAT I report). I also achieved a score of 106/120 on the TOEFL IBT English language test, which is in the 93rd percentile on a global scale. Given the immense effort I put in the last few years, I was able to secure a seat in the 2025 Class of Union College. Union is a very prestigious college among U.S higher education institutes, standing at #44 liberal arts colleges in the nation.</p>

							<h2 class="major">A Support Appeal</h2>
							<p>Although I was able to secure a spot in one of the U.S best colleges out there, there is still one problem that stands an obstacle against me continuing my academic journey: a financial one. Studying in the U.S proves to be quite costly. Union College has offered me a generous grant of $56,317/year for 4 years, covering up to about 71% of the studying fees there. My family will be able to contribute for my education at Union for up to 12.5%, unfortunately leaving about 16% of the studying costs as a hurdle that could stop my pursuit of higher education at a fine higher education institute such as Union College. It would be unfortunate to have to pass on an offer for studying there. I would be very much humbled by the generosity and help of the respected people whose eyes may read my pleas. A contribution to the studies of a single person is a contribution to the knowledge of humanity as a whole. Thanks for your interest.</p>
